                    <p> Developmental screening helps assess your child's growth by using short tests or questionnaires. These tools, based on research, ask about your child's language, movement, thinking, behavior, and emotions.
                        Your child should be screened if you or your doctor have a concern.However, developmental screening is a regular part of some of the well-child visits for all children even if there is not a known concern.</p>
                    <p>Neurodevelopmental screening tests are tools used to identify children who might have developmental delays, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and 
                    Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). These tests are not diagnostic but help determine if a child should be referred for a more comprehensive evaluation.</p>
